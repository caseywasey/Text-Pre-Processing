# Text-Pre-Processing README

## Contents

 + **Overview**
   + "A quick example that can be easily applied to dataframes in machine learning problems using Python V3.0."
   + "This is an educational code snippet that shows an improvement in coding by removing unecessary lines that save transformations for text preprocessing."
   + "Useful for anybody that is doing text data preprocessing for a machine learning project, or who is interested in creating a data transformation pipeline"
   
 + **Getting Started**
   + *_Anaconda_* with *_Jupyter_* Notebooks is my preferred choice for getting started
    + Visit www.anaconda.com and follow the instructions
   + Or, you can install Python and Juptyer Notebooks independently on your machine
    + Python Version 3.0
     + As of 2/3/2018, unsure of any nuances that may break the code in Python 2.7.  Any insights is welcome.
     + Visit for a download of Python Version 3.0 https://www.python.org/downloads/
    + Jupyter Notebooks
     + Visit www.jupyter.org/install to get started
  
 + **Files**
   + *_text+pre+processing.ipynb_*: Python notebook with markdown text
